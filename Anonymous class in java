       Difference between Normal/Regular class and Anonymous Inner class:


**A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at a time.
**A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interface simultaneously. 
But anonymous Inner class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time.
**For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we cant write any constructor for anonymous Inner class because anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor class name and constructor name must be same.
